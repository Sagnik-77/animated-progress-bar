			<h1>Become a Ï€-Shaped Developer</h1>
			<h2>Whats is a Ï€-Shaped Developer?</h2>
			<p>
				A T-shaped person is someone who has deep expertise in a single topic,
				but also broad general knowledge. T-shaped skills are a compromise
				between being a specialist and a generalist. It's considered a great way
				to grow.

				<div class="image"><img src="t-shape.png" alt="t-shape"></div>
				
				<br />But when you look at a typical learning curve, you can see a
				problem:
				
				<div class="image"><img src="learning-curve.png" alt="learning-curve"></div>

				<p>
					After the initial difficult period,
				we see a time of rapid growth. For a few first years as a developer, you
				progress really fast (and so is your salary). As you know more, your
				learning speeds up and you feel the growth month-by-month. But then the
				progress slows down as you reach a certain level of expertise. It's the
				plateau phase. Getting 20% better in the steep growth phase takes days
				or weeks. In the plateau phase it can take years. That's the time when
				the motivation is low and the risk of feeling burned out is high. Then
				there's the problem of competition. For any skill and any niche, the
				differences are small at the top. Because progress is really slow there,
				there's a lot of people with similar skill levels and it's tough to
				stand out based on knowledge/skill only.
				</p>

				<div class="image"><img src="learning-curve-2.png" alt="learning-curve"></div>

				<p>
				<span>That's a problem for many software developers.</span>
				They only specialise in technical skills and they quickly plateau in
				their capability to progress and increase the value they produce.
				</p>
			</p>

			<h2>Pi-shaped skills</h2>
			<p>
				To be competitive, you don't have to be the best at what you do. Our
				jobs are complex. Mastering a single skill is just not enough. A second
				area of expertise can quickly get you ahead of the competition. 

				<div class="image"><img src="pi-shape.png" alt="learning-curve"></div>
				
				<p>
				How many developers do you know who are great in both technical skills and
				communication? Or backend skills combined with UX design? Deep expertise
				with mobile development and real-life experience in running a business?
				<br/>Once again:
				<span>to be competitive, you don't have to be the best at what you do. That
				extra 5% at the expert level might be less valuable than a
				complementary skill you have.</span>
				Bonus point when it comes to motivation: in the second area of
				expertise, you can take advantage of that rapid growth period.
				</p>
				
			</p>

			<h2>Looking for Valuable Skills</h2>
			<p>
				How to find skills worth learning? Look for: 
				<ul>
					<li>combination of skills rarely found in a single person</li>
					<li>skills that complement each other nicely</li>
					<li>skills missing in your organisation / community / field of expertise</li>
					<li>things that naturally interest you</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				<span> Look for problems around you to find inspiration.</span> 
				For example, if you notice that your teamâ€™s communication
				skills are low, becoming a better communicator might be a great idea.
				Look for things that will make you stand out from the crowd.
				</p>
			</p>

			<h2>Some Ideas</h2>
			<p>
				Some of the skills worth specialising in as a developer:
				<ul>
					<li>Writing / presentation skills / mentoring</li>
					<li>Sketching, conveying ideas visually</li>
					<li>General business knowledge</li>
					<li>UI/UX design</li>
					<li>Sales / marketing</li>
					<li>Psychology, cognitive sciences</li>
					<li>Complexity Thinking / Systems Thinking</li>
					<li>Knowledge about the specific business domain you're working with</li>	
					<li>Front-end (JS, Android, iOS) for backend developers; Backend for front-end developers</li>	
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Closing words</h2>
			<p>
				How will you stand out? Do you think getting 5% better in your specialisation 
				will make a big difference? Is that 5% really the best use of your time?
				<br/><br/>Instead, find a skill that could improve the value of your work by 
				50% or 100%. And then learn that.
